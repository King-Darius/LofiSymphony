# Agent Instructions

- Always prioritize ease of use for non-technical users. Favor solutions that allow launching the app with simple clicks or minimal interaction, avoiding command-line requirements whenever possible.
- When proposing or implementing changes, ensure the default experience remains accessible to people with no coding background.
- Prefer documentation and tooling that guides users through graphical or automated setups rather than manual CLI steps.
